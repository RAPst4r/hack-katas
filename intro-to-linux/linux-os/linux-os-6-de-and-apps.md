The desktop environment (DE) component of the Linux OS is what you as the user of the Linux OS can interact with using the built-in or installed applications like file managers for managing files, or web browser for surfing the Internet. There are many desktop environments to choose from based on your preference. Some well known Linux Desktop Environment are GNOME, KDE, LKDE and MATE Desktop.  

In this environment, we do not have a Desktop Environment installed, but if you installed a full version of a Linux OS, you are likely to be presented with a desktop with icons and applications that you can click on and start. Some examples of applications that are installed are office applications, word processing software, email applications and games like Minecraft, Solitaire and Chess.
