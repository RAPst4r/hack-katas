The OS of choice for most hackers is Linux. This is because hackers like to do things their way and because the Linux OS is open source, it can be customized to whatever applications (or hacker tools) that they would like to hack.
Also, unethical and bad hackers use many tools that they develop or is available in Linux to hack into other weak and vulnerable networks and software applications.
Many Linux distros already have the necessary hacker tools readily available to use in them. If a hacker application does not exist, then it can be easily installed on the Linux OS and distributed.

Some very well known hacking Linux distros are:
- Kali Linux based on the Debian flavor of Linux OS
- BackBox based on Ubuntu flavor of Linux OS
- Parrot Security OS based on the Debian flavor of Linux OS
- CAINE which stands for Computer Aided INvestigative Environment which is used for Digital Forensics
and
- Samurai Web Testing Framework for penetration testing web applications.

So if you want to learn hacking as a hobbyist, or for ethical hacking purposes, it is important that you learn and master Linux.
