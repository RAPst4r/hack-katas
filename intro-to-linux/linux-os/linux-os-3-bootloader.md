The Bootloader is what makes the computer start (or boot) up. You may be used to seeing a splash screen show with a message like “Your computer is starting up”. When this splash screen is shown, the bootloader part of the OS is running in the background, making your computer ready for your use.
Bootloader computer viruses corrupt the bootloader part of the OS making it impossible for the computer to start, causing a denial of service or DoS attack.
