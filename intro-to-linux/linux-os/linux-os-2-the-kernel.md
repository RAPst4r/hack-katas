The kernel is the core part of the Linux OS and the kernel is sometimes just referred to as “Linux”. It helps to manage the computer processor, the memory and the attached devices like your DVD drive, USB drive, keyboard, etc. 
When hackers write hacker code that infects and corrupts the Linux kernel, it can lead to what is referred to as “Kernel Panic” and that is a serious threat.
