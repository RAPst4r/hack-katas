When Linux OS was introduced, it was mostly a command line driven OS, which is why it was not as widely adopted as other Graphical OS such as Windows or Mac OSX. However, nowadays, most Linux OSes come with a graphical server that is known as an X server or simply X. The X server makes it possible to display graphics on your monitor.  

In this environment, we do not have X server installed, but if you installed a full version of a Linux OS, you are likely to be presented with a login screen and a graphical user interface that you can click on and interact with the OS. In some Linux distributions, you may be required to start the graphical server by using the `startx`{{execute}} command.
